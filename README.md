# Collatz
A simple playground for Rust.

## Description
I wanted to play around with Rust a little bit to learn the language and didn't really know what to make.

Recently, I watched a [video about the Collatz Conjecture](https://youtu.be/094y1Z2wpJg).  I thought it was interesting, so I created this repo to play around with the Conjecture while learning Rust.

## Roadmap

I would like to modify the program to work from reverse, building a directed graph of all the sequences leading to 1.  This could be parallelized, which would allow for some fun experimentation with threading in Rust.

Also would like to add tests and play around with CI workflows for Rust.
